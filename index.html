<h2>Welcome to Space, Time, and Reality!</h2>
<p>What is space? Is there more to space than the arrangement of things in it? What is time? Is time travel possible? What is the relation between space and time? This course introduces students to the study of the fundamental nature of reality with a focus on the elusive nature of space and time. The course places emphasis on the challenge of finding metaphysical truths about the world given the epistemic constraints imposed by our observational limits. Some representative views from the history of philosophy will be covered, though special attention will be given to contemporary debate.<br><br>Use the menu at the top to navigate to our syllabus, class readings, course assignments, and much more.</p>
